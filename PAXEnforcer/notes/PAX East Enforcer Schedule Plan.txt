PAX East Enforcer Schedule Plan

1.)  Set up classes:  Enforcer, Team - 90% done
2.)  Controller Class:  Input/storing of enforcers + teams
3.)  Output of Enforcers + Teams
4.)  GUI that displays Enforcers + Teams
5.)  Drag & Drop of Enforcers
5.)  Add/Auto-Add Teams
6.)  Calculations for "happiness"


Currently, we assume that each enforcer fills out the entire list of preferences.  
This is not always the case though.  Possible ways to handle it... dump department to fill in the 
nulls.  Or allow filling in a department multiple times (not good because this allows for people to
spam one department). 

Need to consider possibility of removing an enforcer from a department before adding.

How to handle searching for enforcers in an arraylist to remove?  Probably have to iterate through the entire ArrayList
via index and compare using String data (because each Enforcer has to be unique by handle).
